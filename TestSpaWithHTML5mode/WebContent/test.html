NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday removed Arvind Mayaram as finance secretary and appointed Rajasthan chief secretary Rajiv Mehrishi as the new economic affairs secretary.

While talk of Mayaram's departure from North Block has been doing the rounds for several months his exit comes days before the finance ministry starts preparing for the next budget.

Mayaram is the second secretary-rank officer to be shifted out of the finance ministry since BJP took charge in May. Rajeev Takru was earlier removed as revenue secretary.

While there were seven other secretary-rank appointments, the crucial job of coal secretary has been given to Anil Swarup, a 1981-batch IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who has spent the last couple of years removing bottlenecks for infrastructure projects.

He will take charge at a time when the government has to immediately decide on dealing with over 40 coal block allocations which were cancelled by the Supreme Court.

NEW DELHI: Looking to create an environment conducive to industrial development while also ensuring transparency in the labour sector, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched a host of schemes which envisage, among others, portable PF accounts and a unified portal for labour inspection at firms.

Unveiling key labour reforms to end 'inspector raj', Modi inaugurated the 'Pt Deendayal Upadhyay Shramev Jayate Karyakram' organised by the labour ministry here which will feature a day-long conference of labour, employment, health and vocational training ministers of the various state governments.

Labour ministry officials said that the initiatives which are to be launched are a Unified Labour Portal or 'Shram Suvidha', a transparent and accountable Labour Inspection Scheme, and portability through Universal Account Number (UAN) for Employees' Provident Fund members. Also, to be flagged off is an Apprentice Protsahan Yojana.


Speaking at the event, Prime Minister Modi said we needed to change our attitude towards labour as well as work very hard to change the perception we had of the poor.

"In our country, white-collar jobs are given a lot of importance.'Shramev Jayate' equally important as 'Satyameva Jayate'," he said.

The revamped Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) for workers in the unorganised sector will also be launched on the occasion.

The UAN will allow collation of accounts and viewing of updated PF accounts. The UAN would be portable throughout the working careers of members and can be used anywhere in India.

Thus, workers in the organised sector would not need to apply for a transfer of their PF account claim on changing jobs.

Bulk SMSs will be sent across India as part of the programme, the ministry said in a statement here.

"While about one crore EPFO subscribers will get SMSs regarding portability through UAN, about 6.50 lakh establishments and 1,800 inspecting officers will get SMSs about Unified Labour Portal which will (make for) a transparent and accountable Labour Inspection Scheme," the ministry said.
